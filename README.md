STORMlike Chains
================

STORMlike Chains is a Python package for analyzing biopolymers imaged
with single molecule localization microscopies, such as STORM and
PALM. Among other things, the module may be used to generate
individual realizations of biopolymers, to simulate an ensemble of
polymer realizations, or to construct artificial datasets for direct
comparison to microscopy experiments.

The software was originally developed by Kyle Douglass for use in the
Laboratory of Experimental Biophysics at École Polytechnique Fédérale
de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland. He may be contacted at
kyle.douglass@epfl.ch or by visiting http://kmdouglass.github.io.

### Using the software ###

Example scripts that demonstrate how to use the software are found in
the _examples_ folder. These examples cover

1. how to simulate ensembles of wormlike chains from a range of input
   parameters;
2. how to compute the log-likelihood values comparing a simulated
   dataset to an experimental one;
3. how to plot the log-likelihood values.
